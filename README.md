This is a top down farming simulation game on made with Unity. 
As of right now there are many features such as day/night cycle, character movement and inventory system with option to pickup/drop items, sleeping, energy use, planting crops, watering crops, 
crops growing over time, collecting crops, and chest storage space. This is still an early work in progress. 
The next features to be added will be animations on chest opening, and scene changing.
